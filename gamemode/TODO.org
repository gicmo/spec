* Fedora:
** Issues
- [ ] location of the gamemoded daemon (currently /usr/bin)
  Why is it not in /usr/libexec/ (or better /usr/libexec/gamemode)

- [ ] location of the libraries (currently /usr/lib)
  They are unversioned, but maybe that is ok, becasue they are
  internal, i.e. get dlopen'ed by the inlined functions from the
  inlined functions in the header.

** Questions:
- [ ] system user vs system unit
  What is the reason that this is a user unit file, not a system one?

- [ ] man page section for gamemoded (1 vs 8)
  It is a daemon, so should be in secton 8?
