%description
RTags is a client/server application that indexes C/C++ code and keeps
a persistent file-based database of references, declarations,
definitions, symbolnames etc. Thereâ€™s also limited support for
ObjC/ObjC++. It allows you to find symbols by name (including nested
class and namespace scope). Most importantly we give you proper
follow-symbol and find-references support.
